# C++_SnakeGame
A very simple version of the snake game inside the Windows console

I wrote this program when I was in my first year of university. The code doesn't look very good, but it does its thing.
The game has a menu, field and speed settings, some cheat codes, a loading screen (which is completely unnecessary), and even some sounds.
The control is carried out mainly with the keys W, A, S, D, Enter and Escape.

The application is written on ะก++ and works in the Windows console. Interface language is English, but the comments in the code are written in Russian.
